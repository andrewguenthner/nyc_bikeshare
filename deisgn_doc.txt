Desired Product:  Dashboard that quickly and effectively updates key 
stakeholders on New York City's CitiBike program.  Dashboard sections 
per stakeholder requirements will include about 15 key visualizations, 
two specifically-requested maps, and two special features.  The desired 
frequency is monthly, coinciding with the monthly operating report release.
(The latest release is May 2019).  

Rationale:  Why This?  Although key statistics are provided in monthly 
written reports currently, key stakeholders need a faster way to 
consume the information in order to stay informed about the program.

Why Us?  Expertise with Tableau enables us to build this product quickly 
and effectively.

Why Now?  After five years in operation, the "newness" of the program is 
wearing off.  As a result, more effort is needed to maintain stakeholder 
attention, especially since the program will likely still face some 
growing pains that require significant stakeholder attention.



Key Visualizations:

1) Daily average trip growth -- a simple bar graph with values to emphasize 
that the program is still in its growth phase.  To reduce clutter,
values will be tool-tips.  The caption will put the year-over-year growth
number.  Comparisons will be seasonally adjusted.

Data strategy:  Download Q2 csv files for past five years plus current year,
union in Tableau.  

Communication strategy: Average daily rides communicates the scale of the program.  On 
a monthly basis, it is subject to seasonality and variations in weekday / weekend 
prevalence.  The message we want to get across is that this program continues to 
grow, and based on its recent past, it can grow a lot and impact the city, so it 
deserves attention.

2) Year over year trip and subscriber growth, year-to-date -- dual line graph 
with synchronized axes showing year-over-year growth in each month.  Averages
shown in caption.

Data strategy:  Download quarterly csv files for past six quarters, union in Tableau.

Communication strategy:  May YoY growth in trips is unusually low compared to other 
months in 2019.  We want to remind people that subscriber growth is a steady 
15-20% YoY, and that in some months we've seen 35% YoY growth.  In other words, 
big growth (and big impacts) are still on the way ...

Data cleaning:

Quarterly data for q2 2019 (daily summary) has an extra column "Column1" (undefined
entered in all rows) -- this column was manually deleted because Tableau could 
not merge with other years when it was present
